## AWS SDK JS Crypto Helpers

AWS Cryptographic Helpers for Javascript and Node.js

## Scope

This repository collects cryptographic helper packages. We have designed it to gather packages that implement simple primitives for the browser or Node.js. More information about AWS Crypto Tools can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-crypto-tools/index.html?id=docs_gateway#lang/en_us)

## Project Status

This project is still in its early stages. Please send us your feedback. We might make breaking changes in future releases while the SDK is still in developer preview.

## Getting started

Letâ€™s walk through setting up a project that requires a cryptographically secure random value. The following steps use npm as an example. They assume you have node.js and npm already installed.

1. Create a new node.js project.
2. In the project, run: `npm install --save @aws-crypto/random-source-node@preview`
3. Create a new file called index.js, require the function, and then use it to get a random value.

```javascript
const { randomValues } = require("@aws-crypto/random-source-node");
async function example() {
  try {
    const rand = await randomValues(32);
    console.log(rand.length);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}
example();
```
